If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement and the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the websites. The websites are intended for use by persons 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18 years of age, you may not access or use the websites.\n\n<b>Not Legal Advice</b>\n\nOpen Borders is a free immigration guide that is intended to serve as a starting point for determining your immigration options.  The information on the Open Borders and Border Crossing Law Firm websites are not legal advice, and do not form an Attorney-Client relationship.  These websites are not a substitute for the advice or representation of an attorney.  Immigration laws are complex and frequently change.  We tried to take into account hundreds of possible immigration scenarios, but we make no representation that the information in this guide is perfect.  There could be a number of variables in your case that are not fully taken into account in the information provided by this guide.  There could also be immigration relief that you qualify for that this guide does not discover.\n\nAll of the information provided on these websites is meant to be reviewed and confirmed by an immigration attorney prior to taking any action with the U.S. government to file any applications for relief.  The Border Crossing Law Firm expressly disclaims all liability in respect to actions taken or not taken based on the content of the Open Borders and Border Crossing Law Firm websites.  The reader should also be aware that prior results described on these websites do not guarantee a similar outcome.\n\nWe strongly believe that legal representation is critical in immigration cases, and do not encourage you to file any immigration applications without the assistance of an immigration attorney.  If you decide to retain the Border Crossing Law Firm to represent you, then the terms of that agreement are specified in a separate Attorney-Client Contract that will be sent to you.  Unless you retain the Border Crossing Law Firm, we are not your attorneys, and you may not consider the information on our websites to be legal advice.\n\nNeither receipt of information presented on this site nor any e-mail or other electronic communication sent to Border Crossing Law Firm or its lawyers through this site will create an attorney-client relationship.  Accordingly, the attorney-client relationship will not begin until you receive a written statement from us that we represent you (an “Attorney-Client Contract”).Border Crossing Law Firm attorneys named on the website are authorized to practice law in Illinois and Montana, and before any federal administrative tribunal, such as the Executive Office for Immigration review, but may not be authorized to practice law in other state or federal jurisdictions.  Attorneys listed on this website are not Certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.\n\n<b>Attorney Advertising</b>\n\nThe content of the Open Borders and Border Crossing Law Firm websites should be considered attorney advertising, because it is intended to encourage you to hire us to provide legal services to you.\n\n<b>No Government Affiliation</b>\n\nThe Border Crossing Law Firm and Open Borders are not affiliated with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE"), United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"), the Executive Office of Immigration Review ("EOIR"), the Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA"), or any other government entity.\n\n<b>Revisions to the Websites</b>\n\nThe information on the Open Borders and Border Crossing Law Firm websites, including the Legal Disclaimers, Terms of Use Agreement, and Privacy Policy, are subject to change at any time and for any reason without notice.
